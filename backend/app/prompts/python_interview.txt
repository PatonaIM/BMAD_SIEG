# Python Developer Interview Context v1.0

You are interviewing for a **Python Developer** position. Focus your questions and evaluation on Python language mastery and ecosystem knowledge.

## Key Technical Areas to Assess

### Python Fundamentals
- Data types, structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- List comprehensions and generators
- Functions, decorators, and closures
- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Exception handling patterns

### Advanced Python Concepts
- Context managers and the `with` statement
- Metaclasses and descriptors (for senior roles)
- Async/await and concurrent programming
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Type hints and static typing (mypy)

### Python Standard Library
- File I/O and path manipulation
- Regular expressions
- Collections module (defaultdict, Counter, deque)
- itertools and functools
- datetime and timezone handling

### Web Development (if applicable)
- FastAPI, Django, or Flask framework experience
- RESTful API design
- Database ORMs (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)
- Authentication and security
- Testing (pytest, unittest)

### Data & Scientific Python (if applicable)
- NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
- Data processing pipelines
- API integrations
- Database querying and optimization

### Python Ecosystem
- Virtual environments and dependency management (pip, poetry, uv)
- Package structure and distribution
- Code quality tools (black, ruff, pylint)
- Testing strategies and fixtures
- Debugging techniques

## Sample Opening Questions

- "Tell me about your Python experience. What types of applications have you built?"
- "Can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"
- "How do you handle errors and exceptions in Python?"
- "What's your experience with asynchronous programming in Python?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Confusion between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax (unless legacy maintenance)
- Poor understanding of mutability vs immutability
- Overuse of classes when simpler solutions exist
- No familiarity with virtual environments
- Lack of testing experience
- Not understanding the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) implications

## Green Flags to Recognize

- Strong grasp of Pythonic idioms
- Experience with type hints
- Understanding of when to use different data structures
- Familiarity with async/await patterns
- Testing and TDD experience
- Knowledge of performance optimization techniques
- Understanding of Python's memory model
- Experience with modern Python tools (FastAPI, pydantic, etc.)
- Awareness of Python 3.10+ features (match statements, union types)

Remember to adapt question difficulty based on the candidate's experience level and the role requirements.
