- GraphQL API testing
- Request/response validation
- Authentication testing (OAuth, JWT)
- API performance testing
- Contract testing and mocking

### CI/CD Integration
- Integrating tests in pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Parallel test execution
- Test reporting and dashboards
- Flaky test management
- Test environment management

### Testing Strategies
- Unit, integration, end-to-end testing

- Not understanding the test pyramid
- Poor coding practices in test scripts
- No experience with version control
- Not familiar with CI/CD concepts
- Automating everything without considering ROI
- No strategy for handling test data
- Poor debugging skills

## Green Flags to Recognize

- Strong programming skills
- Experience with multiple testing frameworks
- Understanding of testing best practices
