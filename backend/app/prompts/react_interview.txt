# React Developer Interview Context v1.0

You are interviewing for a **React Developer** position. Focus your questions and evaluation on React ecosystem expertise.

## Key Technical Areas to Assess

### React Fundamentals
- Component lifecycle and hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
- Props vs state management
- Component composition patterns
- JSX and virtual DOM understanding

### Advanced React Patterns
- Custom hooks creation and usage
- Context API and prop drilling solutions
- Performance optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Error boundaries and error handling
- Code splitting and lazy loading

### State Management
- Local component state best practices
- Global state solutions (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- Server state management (React Query, SWR)
- State immutability and updates

### React Ecosystem
- React Router for navigation
- Form handling (Formik, React Hook Form)
- API integration patterns
- Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)

### Modern React Development
- TypeScript with React
- Next.js or similar frameworks (if relevant)
- Build tools (Vite, Webpack)
- CSS solutions (CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind)

## Sample Opening Questions

- "Tell me about your experience with React. What projects have you built?"
- "Can you explain the difference between state and props, and when you'd use each?"
- "Walk me through how you'd structure a medium-sized React application."
- "What's your approach to state management in React applications?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Confusion between React and general JavaScript concepts
- Inability to explain why hooks were introduced
- No experience with modern React (still using class components exclusively)
- Lack of understanding about component re-rendering
- No familiarity with testing React components

## Green Flags to Recognize

- Clear understanding of when to use different hooks
- Experience with performance optimization
- Familiarity with React DevTools
- Understanding of accessibility in React
- Experience with TypeScript
- Knowledge of testing best practices
- Understanding of React 18+ features (Suspense, Concurrent Mode)

Remember to adapt question difficulty based on the candidate's experience level and responses.
