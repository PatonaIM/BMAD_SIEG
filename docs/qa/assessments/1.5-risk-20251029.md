---

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: State Consistency in Concurrent Updates

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Multiple async operations update session state simultaneously  
**Impact:** High (3) - Data corruption, incorrect difficulty transitions, lost progression history

**Risk Description:**
The progression engine updates multiple JSONB fields (`progression_state`, `skill_boundaries_identified`, `current_difficulty_level`) across async operations. Race conditions could cause:
- Lost updates when two responses process simultaneously
- Inconsistent state between JSONB fields
- Incorrect difficulty transitions based on stale data
- Phase history corruption or duplication

**Affected Components:**
- `ProgressiveAssessmentEngine.update_progression_state()`
- `InterviewEngine.process_candidate_response()`
- `InterviewSession` JSONB fields: `progression_state`, `skill_boundaries_identified`
- Database transaction boundaries

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Implement Row-Level Locking:**
   \`\`\`python
   session = await db.execute(
       select(InterviewSession)
       .where(InterviewSession.id == session_id)
       .with_for_update()  # PostgreSQL row lock
   )
   \`\`\`
2. **Use Database Transactions:** Wrap all state updates in single transaction
3. **Implement Optimistic Locking:** Add version field, check on update
4. **Atomic JSONB Updates:** Use PostgreSQL JSONB operators for atomic field updates
5. **Add State Validation:** Verify state consistency before/after updates

**Testing Requirements:**
- Concurrency tests: Simulate 5+ simultaneous responses to same session
- Transaction rollback tests: Verify no partial state updates
- State consistency validation: Check all JSONB fields align after updates
- Load testing: 100+ concurrent interviews to detect race conditions

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Some edge cases may remain in high-load scenarios

**Owner:** Backend Dev Team  
**Timeline:** Before Task 6 (Progression State Tracking) completion

---

### 2. [TECH-002]: Infinite Loop in Difficulty Progression

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Complex state machine logic with multiple transition conditions  
**Impact:** High (3) - Interview hangs, resource exhaustion, database bloat, poor UX

**Risk Description:**
The progression algorithm could enter infinite loops if:
- Transition conditions never met due to AI response inconsistency
- Threshold configuration errors (e.g., impossible thresholds)
- Edge case where response quality oscillates around threshold
- `questions_asked_count` not incremented on errors
- Maximum question limits not enforced per phase

**Affected Components:**
- `ProgressiveAssessmentEngine.determine_next_difficulty()`
- `ProgressiveAssessmentEngine.should_advance_difficulty()`
- Phase transition logic in Tasks 3 & 7
- Question generation loop

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Hard Limits Per Phase:**
   \`\`\`python
   MAX_QUESTIONS = {"warmup": 5, "standard": 12, "advanced": 8}
   if session.questions_count >= MAX_QUESTIONS[phase]:
       force_advance_or_complete()
   \`\`\`
2. **Always Increment Counter:** Even on errors, increment `questions_asked_count`
3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** After N failed transitions, force advance
4. **Monotonic Progression:** Once advanced, never regress (already specified)
5. **Timeout Guards:** Set maximum interview duration (e.g., 60 minutes)
6. **State Machine Validation:** Unit test all state transitions exhaustively

**Testing Requirements:**
- Edge case tests: Threshold boundary values (0.699, 0.701 for 0.7 threshold)
- Stuck state tests: AI returns borderline responses repeatedly
- Error path tests: Verify counter increments even when AI fails
- Maximum question tests: Verify forced completion at limits
- State machine tests: All possible transition paths covered

**Residual Risk:** Low - Hard limits provide fail-safe mechanisms

**Owner:** Backend Dev Team  
**Timeline:** During Task 3 (Difficulty Advancement Logic) implementation

## High Risks

### 3. [TECH-003]: AI Response Parsing Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - LLM outputs can be unpredictable  
**Impact:** High (3) - Interview crashes, incorrect difficulty assessment, poor candidate experience

**Risk Description:**
OpenAI API responses for response analysis and question generation may:
- Return malformed JSON despite prompt instructions
- Omit required fields (confidence_level, proficiency_signal)
- Return values outside expected ranges (e.g., confidence = 1.5)
- Fail silently with empty responses
- Timeout or rate limit during analysis

**Mitigation:**
- Implement Pydantic validation for all AI responses
- Add JSON schema validation before parsing
- Provide default fallback values for missing fields
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (from Story 1.4)
- Log all parsing failures with full response for debugging
- Graceful degradation: Continue interview with current difficulty on failure

**Testing:**
- Mock malformed AI responses in unit tests
- Fuzz testing with invalid JSON structures
- Integration tests with OpenAI API rate limiting
- Error recovery tests: Verify interview continues after parse failure

---

### 4. [PERF-001]: JSONB Query Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - JSONB grows large as interview progresses  
**Impact:** High (3) - Slow response times, poor candidate experience, database load

**Risk Description:**
As interviews progress, `progression_state` JSONB field accumulates:
- 10-20 phase history entries
- 15-25 response quality history entries
- Growing skills_explored and boundary_detections arrays
- Conversation memory from LangChain (Story 1.4)

Large JSONB fields cause:
- Slow read/write operations (network transfer overhead)
- Inefficient in-memory manipulation
- Database query slowdown without proper indexing

**Mitigation:**
- Implement JSONB size limits (max 100KB per field)
- Add GIN indexes on JSONB fields for faster queries
- Implement JSONB field pruning: Keep only last 10 response quality entries
- Use PostgreSQL JSONB operators for targeted updates (avoid full field rewrite)
- Cache session state in memory during request lifecycle
- Monitor JSONB field sizes in production

**Testing:**
- Performance tests with large JSONB payloads (20+ questions)
- Database query timing benchmarks
- Load testing: 50+ concurrent interviews with growing state
- JSONB index effectiveness validation

---

### 5. [DATA-001]: Progression State Corruption

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Complex JSONB schema manipulation  
**Impact:** High (3) - Invalid state causes downstream failures, interview cannot continue

**Risk Description:**
Manual JSONB field manipulation risks:
- Invalid JSON syntax (unclosed brackets, missing commas)
- Schema violations (missing required fields, wrong types)
- Orphaned references (skill in boundaries but not in explored list)
- Timestamp format inconsistencies (ISO8601 vs epoch)
- Null handling issues (null vs missing vs empty array)

**Mitigation:**
- Define Pydantic models for all JSONB schemas
- Validate JSONB structure before database write
- Use JSONB builder functions instead of string concatenation
- Implement schema migration strategy for progression_state evolution
- Add database constraints where possible (JSONB check constraints)
- Comprehensive error handling with state rollback

**Testing:**
- Schema validation tests for all JSONB structures
- Null/empty state handling tests
- JSONB serialization/deserialization round-trip tests
- Database constraint violation tests
- State corruption recovery tests

---

### 6. [TECH-004]: Skill Boundary Detection False Positives/Negatives

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - AI analysis subjective, thresholds arbitrary  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Inaccurate skill assessment, poor question selection, suboptimal interview

**Risk Description:**
AI-driven skill boundary detection may incorrectly classify proficiency:
- **False Positives:** Mark candidate at boundary when competent (blocks valid question paths)
- **False Negatives:** Miss actual boundaries (repeat questions candidate can't answer)
- Threshold sensitivity: 0.5 boundary threshold may not fit all skill areas
- Cultural/communication style bias: Confident but wrong vs hesitant but correct
- Skill area mapping inconsistencies: Same skill labeled differently

**Mitigation:**
- Make boundary threshold configurable per skill area
- Implement multi-signal boundary detection (not just confidence level)
- Track consecutive low-confidence responses (2-3) vs single dip
- Add manual override capability for recruiters to adjust boundaries
- Collect telemetry on boundary detection accuracy for threshold tuning
- Implement "boundary confirmation" questions before final marking

**Testing:**
- Unit tests with various confidence/accuracy combinations
- False positive tests: High accuracy, low confidence
- False negative tests: Low accuracy, high confidence
- Threshold sensitivity analysis (0.4, 0.5, 0.6 thresholds)
- A/B testing framework for threshold optimization

- Add indexes on `InterviewSession.candidate_id` and `InterviewSession.interview_id`
- Add GIN indexes on JSONB fields for skill boundary queries
- Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed

---

### 12. [BUS-001]: Progression Algorithm Doesn't Match Interview Goals

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Algorithm designed without user research  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Interviews too short/long, candidate frustration, inaccurate assessments
