nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Password stored as hash (password_hash field) - hashing implementation deferred to auth story
      - No plaintext sensitive data in logs or responses
      - Database credentials properly managed via environment variables
      - Supabase connection uses TLS (implicit in pooler.supabase.com)
      - Prepared statement caching disabled for pgbouncer compatibility
      - UUID primary keys prevent enumeration attacks
      - Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes maintain referential integrity
      - No SQL injection vectors (using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Connection pooling configured: pool_size=10, max_overflow=20 (30 concurrent)
      - pool_pre_ping=True ensures connection health before use
      - Async engine with asyncpg (fastest PostgreSQL driver)
      - Strategic indexes on high-query columns (email, status, foreign keys, timestamps)
      - GIN indexes on JSONB columns for efficient nested queries
      - Composite index on (interview_id, sequence_number) for chronological retrieval
      - NullPool in tests prevents connection exhaustion
      - Test execution: 17 tests in 47.66s (acceptable for integration tests with real DB)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Alembic migrations with version control (revision 075e167c8434)
      - Upgrade/downgrade cycle tested successfully (including enum cleanup)
      - Cascading deletes prevent orphaned records
      - Database health check in /health endpoint (SELECT 1 query)
      - init_db() verifies connection on startup
      - close_db() properly disposes connections on shutdown
      - Separate test database isolates test data from development
      - Session pooler (port 5432) used instead of transaction pooler for prepared statement support
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Clean separation: models in app/models/, tests mirror structure
      - All models inherit from Base with consistent patterns
      - Type hints throughout (SQLAlchemy 2.0 style)
      - Comprehensive docstrings on models and functions
      - Consistent naming: snake_case tables/columns, PascalCase models
      - __repr__() methods on all models for debugging
      - 96% code coverage (182/189 statements)
      - Zero linting issues (ruff checks pass)
      - Clear migration history with descriptive messages
