# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.7
schema: 1
story: "1.7"
story_title: "Real-Time Interview Conversation Flow"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation architecturally sound but has 2 CRITICAL blockers: (1) NFR2 performance violated (6-10s vs <2s requirement), and (2) missing interview completion logic. All integration tests fail due to enum mismatch."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
